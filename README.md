# Custom-Sign-in-with-JS

The objective of this project was to learn how signing in users work on a bakcend level. So I made a custom sign in and authentication system using JavaScript

## The application does't work anymore as the online database used (MongoDB) is no longer existing

To run it on your machine, start by cloning the repo with:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DijiOfficial/FullStack-Task-Manager-With-sqlite3.git
```
Move into the repo and download the dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```
And run it using: 
```bash
npm start
```
Finally you can check it out on http://localhost:3000 !

To stop the application simply press "Ctrl + C" in the terminal.
